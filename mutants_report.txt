# Cargo Mutants Report

## Summary
Attempted to run mutation testing on the `ironclaw` project using `cargo mutants`.

## Findings

1. **Large Scale**: The project contains **8438 mutants** in total when targeting the full codebase.
2. **Compilation Constraints**: The project has heavy dependencies including:
   - `wasmtime` (v28)
   - `libsql` (v0.6)
   - `pgvector`
   - `axum`, `tokio-postgres`, etc.

   These dependencies result in very long compilation times (exceeding 10+ minutes) in the test environment, causing `cargo mutants` (and even `cargo test`) to time out during the baseline compilation phase.

3. **Focused Attempt**:
   - Targeted `src/util.rs` specifically.
   - Found **12 mutants** in this file.
   - Baseline compilation for this subset also timed out due to the need to link the main binary with all dependencies.

## Broken Tests
Unable to confirm broken tests as the test suite could not complete compilation within the available time.

## Recommendation
To run mutation testing effectively on this project:
- Use a machine with more powerful CPU/RAM or longer timeout limits.
- Use `cargo mutants --in-place` (with caution) to avoid full rebuilds, or pre-compile dependencies in the mutation sandbox.
- Isolate unit tests into a separate crate or configuration that doesn't require linking heavy integration dependencies like `wasmtime` if possible.
